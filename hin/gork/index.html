 <small><dir>God is Infinite. Infinite are the Forms in which He manifests Himself. Infinite also are the ways leading to Him.--p. 312</small></dir>
 <P>
 Sri Ramakrishna, (1836-1886) was a Bengali mystic who had a huge impact
 on the development of modern Hinduism.
 His chief disciple, Swami Vivekananda, not only helped revive Hinduism
 in India, but also introduced Hinduism to the West.
 Ramakrishna was a non-dualist worshippper of the Goddess Kali.
 However, he also experimented with Christianity and Islam, and repeatedly
 preached the diversity of paths to God.

 This is the story of Ramakrishna told first-hand 
 as a series of days and nights spent
 with his disciples and lay followers.
 Imagine someone following Buddha or Jesus around with a steno pad
 and then publishing candid transcripts of their notes.
 This is the Victorian-era equivalent.
 We watch Ramakrishna go into his trances, sing devotional
 songs, and dispense parables.
 We get to listen into his profound discourses,
 including lucid descriptions of very high-level yogic techniques.
 This is a unique look at a holy man.--J.B. Hare

 <P>
 Production notes: this is a completely new scan of
 different, and earlier translation of this work than the edition
 previously seen elsewhere on the web, translated by Swami Nikhilananda.
 The author listed as &quot;M&quot; was apparently
 Mahendra Nath Gupta (1855-1932), who transcribed the notes into a five
 volume Bengali edition, and later translated them into English.
 The English translations of the <CITE>Gospel of Ramakrishna</CITE>,
 this one included, are derived from his work.

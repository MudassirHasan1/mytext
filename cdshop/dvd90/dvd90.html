 <IMG SRC="../img/tinit.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">THE INTERNET SACRED TEXT ARCHIVE DVD-ROM 9.0 has electronic texts of over 1700 of the most important books ever written, most of which were transcribed especially for sacred-texts. Years of research and scholarship went into this product: all the core texts of religion, mythology, folklore and the esoteric on one disk.
 </P>
 <P>
 For centuries these texts were stashed in dusty libraries. Now you can finally unlock the secrets of the ages on your home computer. Scholars have only dreamed of this kind of access, now it is just a mouse click away!
 </P>
 <P>
 You get the full text of each book, many with footnotes and illustrations. To buy all of these books you would have to spend a small fortune, even if you could find them: many are out of print and hard to obtain at any price. We spent over a quarter million dollars putting this disk together. You pay only $99.95--just pennies a book. Worldwide shipping is free when you buy direct!
 </P>
 <P>
 Everything on the disk can be viewed in a standard web browser on your PC or Macintosh. Proceeds from sales of Sacred-texts on disk go to support free worldwide access to the Internet Sacred Text Archive on the web (sacred-texts.com) and development of new etexts. 
 </P>
 <HR>
 For the 9.0 version, we have added hundreds of plain text, single
 file versions of the books on the disk so that you can download
 them from the disk and use them in your ebook reader,
 convert them into other formats, use them with your screen
 reading software, etc. Look for links on the index pages
 labeled 'Text [Zipped].'</P>
 <P>
 <I>It's like getting hundreds of Kindle books for free in addition to the DVD-ROM!!!</I>

         traditions and folklore that go back to the dawn of humanity. Take a trip 
         to the Kalahari, Siberia, or the Australian outback and hear the oldest

 <P>Here's what customers are saying about the DVD-ROM:</P>
 <LI>
 ... it will be a great bargain as anyone that collects books on these topics will recognize.
 <LI>I loved the search index and will use it greatly
 <LI>I think it is very good value, even with the exchange rate differences. Books are very expensive in Australia anyway, so for me any electronic reference library is good value.
 <LI>I was able to navigate easily through things.... I think [the price] is very fair.... that's a lot of data having it in one place is very handy
 <LI>It seems very well done, all around very high quality.
 <LI>$99.95 seems quite reasonable for a disk such as this.

 This is an excellent product. Hours and hours of material to search through. Books I've never even heard of and some I've been searching for. This is a very important thing that this disk represents and I want to thank you for making this available.... $99.95 is a very realistic price for this product, as it is packed with material.
 </B>--<I>customer review</I>.

 </table>
 
 <LI>The ISTA web site is the most elegant, intuitive and comprehensive site that I've found for unusual and historically important sacred writings.  The scope of material you have included is almost beyond belief.  Needless to say, the CD and DVD reflect the fine quality that went into the web site.  I do have a DVD-ROM drive (now - I was prompted to get the DVD drive solely to use the ISTA DVD).  The DVD-ROM works perfectly and the main index page came up immediately. I tried using all of the search functions and that also worked perfectly. ... Based on the content of the DVD-ROM, a price of $99.95 is a super bargain.  
 <LI>Thanks for the DVD and the service you provide by making these excellent works available for everyone for our enrichment.
 <LI>Great work at a good price. 
 <LI>...the disk and the search seem great. There are so many texts!  And the search function is VERY handy for dealing with all of those texts
 <LI>The search feature is excellent, exactly what I was looking for on the CD.
 <LI>The price is fitting just for double the content. The search feature is an added and much needed bonus.
 <LI>... it will be a great bargain as anyone that collects books on these topics will recognize.
 
 <LI>I think $99.95 is a very reasonable price for the DVD Rom, I will buy it and may even buy a gift or two for friends.
 <LI>Neither disc is difficult to use, but I love the DVD! Very, very nice, easy navigation. 
 <LI>This is definitely a great project, very ambitious and a generous contribution to the entire world community at large.

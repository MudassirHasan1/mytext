 <HR>
 <P><B>COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PRODUCT LINE</B></P>
 <P><I>What is the Sacred-texts DVD-ROM?</I></P>
 <P>The Sacred-Texts DVD-ROM and FFLASH DRIVE contains the entire contents of the website,
 free of advertisements.
 The media has the complete text of hundreds of books on it--it's like
 having an entire library in the palm of your hand.
 </P>
 <P><I>What are on the World Religions, Myth and Folklore, and Magick and Mystery CD-ROMs?</I></P>
 <P>The CD-ROMs contains a large selection from the website,
 free of advertisements, on the particular topic of the disk.
 </P>
 <P>
 <P><I>If I buy all three CD-ROMs, do they add up to the same books on the DVD-ROM?</I></P>
 <P>No, the DVD-ROM or FLASH DRIVE has many books on it that are not on any of the CD-ROMs.
 </P>
 <P><I>Are these audio or video disks?</I></P>
 <P>No. The media contain text because that is the most efficient way to
 store the information. An audio or video of <I>just one</I> book would
 take up an entire disk, possibly more.
 </P>
 <P><I>I'm not a computer expert. How easy is it to use?</I></P>
 <P>
 It's not rocket science.
 If you have a PC, just put it in the disk drive and it starts.
 No need to install anything on your system.
 Note: the FLASH DRIVE will not starT on Windows 7 and 8 because of Microsoft restrictions.
 Point your browser to the file index.htm. It also works fine on the Macintosh and Unix systems, even though
 it doesn't start automatically on those computers. </P>
 </P><I>I'm hesitant to buy things online.</I></P>
 <P>
 It's safe and easy to purchase the disk online.
 We use a system which does not disclose your credit or debit card information
 to us: we never see your financial information, and it is not stored
 at our website ever.
 All we get is your shipping address and an invoice for what you have bought.
 </P>
 </P><I>What happens after I buy?</I></P>
 <P>
 Immediately after you place an online order from our site, you will get
 an emailed receipt with your requested shipping address, the amount you paid,
 and a firm date when your order will be shipped.
 If you have any questions whatsoever, you can reply to that email and we
 will respond promptly.
 </P>
 </P><I>How can I buy without using PayPal?</I></P>
 <P>
 If you don't want to buy online, use the <A HREF="cart.html">shopping cart</A>
 and place a mail order.
 This does not send any personal information over the internet.
 Simply fill in what you want to buy, press a button, and your invoice
 will be displayed in your browser with complete shipping information and
 the total price of your order.
 Print it out and send it in using postal mail, along with your payment.
 We accept checks, money orders and cash.
 If you specify an email, you will get an emailed receipt the day we
 ship the product.
 </P>
 <I>Where can you ship the product?</I>
 </P>
 <P>
 Anywhere in the world.
 We ship by postal mail in a padded envelope.
 For orders in the US, where possible,
 we add US Postal Service delivery confirmation
 so that your order can be tracked online if necessary.
 </P>
 </P>
 <I>How long will it take to ship?</I>
 </P>
 Media orders in the US are shipped by 3-day Priority.
 All other orders are sent by first class mail.
 International orders are shipped via Air Letter Post, which normally takes
 one to four weeks to arrive anywhere in the world.
 If you don't get your order in the amount of time we specified in the
 emailed receipt, we will reship another copy immediately.

 		Having an Internet connection active while using the disk
 		is completely optional.</p>
 	
 	  <P> Q: Can I use the files from the disk on an E-Book reader such as the Amazon Kindle?<br>
 	  A: Most of the newer files on the CD-ROM and DVD-ROM have single-file, plain text versions. Look for the link that says 'text (zipped)'. You can transfer these files to your Kindle or E-Book reader easily.
 	  In addition, we have prepared special Kindle editions of some of our most popular books. A list is available <A HREF="kindle.html">here</a>.</P>
 
       <p> Q: Can you contact me when a new version is available?<br>
         A: Of course! Read the material below about the
 		<A HREF="#upgrades">upgrade program</A>.</p>
 		
       <p> Q: Do I need any special software 
         to use the disk?<br>
         A: No, just a web browser.
 		If you can see this page on your PC or Macintosh

 		you to install anything on your system.</p>
 
       <p> Q: Is the disk in English?<br>
         A: Just like the website, the primary language of the disk is English.
 		Most files are in English.
 		A number of texts on the disk are provided both
 		in English translation and
 		the language that they were originally composed in.</p>
 	  <a name="translate"></a>
 	   <p> Q: Do you have the disk translated into French, Spanish, German, etc.<br>
 	    A: No. (also see the <A HREF="../faq.html#translate">main FAQ</A>). </p>
 
       <p> Q: Is the disk just a bunch of links to your website?<br>

 	  <h3>DVD-ROM Questions</h3>
 	  <P>NEW: <B>Need a DVD-ROM drive? <A HREF="dvdrom.html">Click here to buy one</A></B></P>
 	  <p> Q: What is a DVD-ROM?<BR>
 	     A: A DVD-ROM is a high-density data disk much like a CD-ROM, but
 		 with several times the capacity.
 		 Most computers shipped within the past five years have DVD-ROM drives.
 	  </p>
 
 		<p> Q: Can I play it in my DVD player on my TV set?<BR>
 		A: No, you need a computer with a DVD-ROM drive.</p>
 
 		<p> Q: Is the DVD-ROM a video?<br>
 		A: No.</p>
 
 		<p> Q: How do I know if my computer has a DVD-ROM drive?<br>
 		A: It will say 'DVD-ROM' on the front panel of the drive.</p>
 
 		<p> Q: What if my computer doesn't have a DVD-ROM drive?<br>
 		A: You will need to upgrade your system by purchasing and
 		installing a DVD-ROM drive.
 		DVD-ROM drives cost as little as $10 now, and can
 		be obtained from any office supply or computer retailer.
 		You can buy an internal drive and replace an existing CD-ROM drive.
 		This is the least expensive option: this will require a
 		screwdriver and about ten minutes to install.
 		Or you can spend a bit more and buy an external drive.
 		These plug into a USB port and do not require any
 		installation.
 		</p>
 
       <a name="upgrades"></a>

       <p> Q: Are there upgrades to the disk?<br>

         mail in your registration card to take advantage of this offer.

 	 <p>Q: I'm eligible for an upgrade but can't figure out where to buy one.<BR>
 	 A: The upgrade is sold from a secret page. The address of this page
 	   is emailed to qualified customers when a new upgrade is ready.
 	 </p>
 
 	 <p>Q: I didn't get an upgrade email, but I'm qualified.<BR>
 	 A: Your spam filter may have intercepted it, or you may have deleted it without reading it. Email us to request the secret upgrade page address.</p>
 
 
       <p> Q: What is the current version of the DVD-ROM
         product and when will it be upgraded?<br>
         A: The current version is 9.0.
 		It was released November 20, 2009 and we do yet not have a specific plan
 		yet for an upgrade, although we plan to issue upgrades for this
 		product in the future.
 	  </p>
 
       <p> Q: What if I buy the current
 	  product and you release a new version shortly afterwards?<br>
 	  A: When the new version is released, we send out free upgrades to
 	  a certain number of the most recent purchasers of the product, both
 	  to address this concern and as a test run.
 	  </p>
 	   
 
 	  <p>Q: When will the final or next version be ready?<br>
          A: We do not preannounce future versions.
 	  </p>
       <p> Q: Why should I buy it now, if a new version will be out next year?<br>
 		A: The upgrade program is intended to address just this concerns,
 		protecting your investment both in the product, and the continued
 		work of the site.
 	  </p>
 
 
 	  <p> Q: Who is qualified to purchase the 9.0 DVD-ROM upgrade?<BR>
 	  A: Anyone who purchased a CD-ROM prior to the release of the 6.0
 	  DVD-ROM (October 6, 2006) or who purchased the a DVD-ROM (versions 6-8)
 	  subsequently.

       <p> Q: Does the upgrade only have new material added since the last version?<BR>
 	  Q: If I buy an upgrade version as a gift will the person who gets it
 	  also have to get a copy of the previous version?<BR>
 
 
 	  A: No. The upgrade has everything on the previous version
 	  in addition to material added to the site since the last
 	  version.
 	  That is, it is has the same contents as the currently
 	  shipping retail version.
 	  You can give it as a gift to someone who doesn't have any previous
 	  version and they will get the complete product.

       <h3>Using the disk</h3>
 
       <p> Q: How do I use the product on the PC?<br>
         A: Insert the disk. Your browser should automatically start the disk
         home page.</p>
       <p> Q: The disk did not start automatically on my PC.<br>
         A: You probably have AutoPlay disabled. Double click on 'My Computer' 
         and locate the drive which has the sacred-texts disk in it. Now 
         you can either right click on the disk icon and select 'AutoPlay', or 
         open the disk by double clicking on it then double click on the file 
         'index.htm'.
 		For more information on solving this issue, please refer to the
 		<A HREF="support.html">Technical Support</A> page.
 	  </p>
       <p> Q: How do I use the product on the Macintosh?<br>
         A: 1. Insert the disk. 2. Open the disk icon that appears on your 
         desktop. 3. Open your browser and drag the file 'index.htm' to your browser 
         window. Hint: after you do this, bookmark the page index.htm; this will 
         allow you to skip steps 2 and 3 in the future.</p>
 	  <p>Q: What if I have problems using the disk?<br>
 	  A: The <A HREF="support.html">technical support</A> page covers
 	  all of the common issues, and if you have any other questions
 	  about using the disk, feel free to <A HREF="../contact.html">contact us
 	  by email</A>.

       <h3>Problems Ordering Using PayPal</h3>
 
 	  <P> Q: How can I get help with PayPal?<br>
 	  A: If you have questions about PayPal, you can call them toll-free at 1-888-221-1161, 4:00 AM PDT to 10:00 PM PDT Monday through Friday, or 6:00 AM PDT to 8:00 PM PDT on Saturday and Sunday. Note: you can hit 'zero' at any time to bypass the voice menus. If you are having technical issues with PayPal you can also call their technical support line at 1-800-852-1973.
 	  </P>
 
       <p> Q: The shopping cart isn't working.<br>
         A:  The sacred-texts shopping cart requires that your browser
 		support JavaScript and cookies, and that these features be turned on.
 		All current browsers support these features, so this should not be
 		an issue in the vast majority of cases.
 		However, if you have any problems using the shopping cart,
 		please <a href="../contact.html">email us</a> promptly and include as 
         much information about what happened as possible,
 		including your operating system and which browser you are using.
 		This information will help us determine the source of the problem
 		and how to fix it.
 	  </p>
 	
 	  <p> Q: PayPal rejected my credit card.<br>
 	  A: We don't have any control over PayPal's policies or website.
 	  The most common problem is that you need to enter your credit
 	  card's billing address correctly.
 	  Your credit card also needs
 	  to be in a country which PayPal allows payments from (see below 'Can I use PayPal from my country?).
 	  </P>
 
 	  <p>Q: I need the product sent somewhere else than my billing address.<BR>
 	  A: If you need the shipment sent to an address other than your
 	  credit card's billing address, please note it in the 'comment' field
 	  at PayPal and email the correct shipping address promptly.
 	  You can do so by replying to our autoresponse email.
 	  </p>
 
 	  <p>Q: I accidentally paid twice at PayPal.<BR>
 	  A: This can occur because you used your browser's
 	  'Back' button after you completed your payment at PayPal,
 	  or clicked on the payment button twice because your system
 	  was responding slowly.
 	  If this occurs, we will promptly refund the duplicate payment.
 	  </p>
 
 	  <p>Q: Can I use PayPal from my country?<br>
 	   A: To see which countries you can order using PayPal from click
 	   on the following link:
 	   <A HREF="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-approved-signup-countries-outside">List of countries you can use PayPal in</A>.
 	  </p>
 
       <p> Q: PayPal is not available in my country.<br>
         A: You can purchase the product through Amazon or by mail order.</p>
 
       <a name="howpay"></a>  
       <h3>Payment issues</h3>
 
 	  <p>Q: What is your return policy?<br>
 	  A: If you purchased the product, and for any reason you are not
 		satisfied with it, you can return the disk within 60 days
 		for a complete refund.
 		If you bought it using PayPal, we can issue a refund
 		immediately.
 		If you bought it using mail order, we can issue a refund by check.
 	  </p>
 		<p>
 		Note that Amazon has a different set of return policies.
 		If you buy it from Amazon, you will have to use their return
 		policy.</p>
 
 
       <p> Q: What do you mean by 'A check or money order drawn on a US bank?'<br>
 	    A: This question sometimes comes up on international mail orders. The check or money order must be denominated in United States currency (i.e. it must be in US $), and it must have a United States bank routing number on it. Most large banks outside the US can issue such a check and have a partership with a US bank for exactly this purpose. Sacred-text's bank charges a fee or rejects checks not meeting this criteria.</p>
       <p> Q: Is the library price the same as the retail price?<br>
 	    A: Yes.</p>
       <p> Q: I don't have a credit card and want to buy online.<br>
         A: You can also use your debit card checking account at PayPal.</p>
       <p> Q: I don't have a checking account or a credit card,
 	  	and live outside the US.<br>
         A: You can purchase the product by mail order using
 		an international money order which you can obtain from banks,
 		post offices and other businesses.
 		The money order must be in US dollars and drawn on a US bank.
 		You can also have most banks generate a check in
 		US dollars drawn on a US bank.
 		Note that 'check' is the same thing as a 'cheque' or a 'bank draft'.
 	  </p>
       <p> Q: Can I order the product by mail order using a credit card?<br>
 	    A: No.  We cannot accept credit card payments by mail order.</p>
       <p> Q: Can I buy using a Travellers Check?<br>
         A: Yes, if it's denominated in US dollars and drawn on a US bank.</p>
 	  <p>Q: Can I send you US currency to pay for a mail order?<br>
 	  	A: That's acceptable, but you do so at your own risk.</p>
       <p> Q: Can I buy using a Purchase Order?<br>
         A: No.</p>
 	  <p class="p-small">
 	  <hr width="25%">
 	  There are three ways to pay.<BR>
 	  You can use a credit card and purchase using PayPal or Amazon.<BR>
 	  You can use your checking account and purchase using PayPal.<BR>
 	  You can send a check or money order in US dollars drawn on a
 	  US bank accompanying a filled-out mail order form.<BR>
 	  This fact hasn't prevented people from suggesting other ingenious ways
 	  to pay for the product.
 	  </p>
       <p>
 	    Q: Can I barter (send goods) in payment?<br>
         A: No, absolutely not.</p>
 		</p>
       <p> Q: Can I buy using a wire transfer?<br>
         A: No.</p>
       <p> Q: Can I buy the using an International Paying Card?<br>
         A: No.</p>
       <p> Q: Can I transfer money directly to your bank account, I just need your banking info...<br>
         A: No.</p>
       <p> Q: Can I buy by sending money to you via Western Union?<br>
         A: No.</p>
       <p>etc. etc. etc....</p>
 
       <a name="shipping"></a>  
       <h3>Shipping</h3>
 	  <p class="normal">Q: What does free shipping include?<br>
 	  A: Within the US, USPS 3 day priority with delivery confirmation. Outside the US, Air Letter Post.
 	  Within the US, upgrades and back-issues of the CD-ROM are sent
 	  by first class postal mail.
 	  </p>
 	  
 
       <p> Q: I ordered a copy directly from 
         sacred texts and it hasn't arrived!<br>
         A: The vast majority of shipments get there on time. However, in a handful 
         of cases, packages have been lost or stolen in transit, or returned undelivered, 
         even though the mailing address was correct.</p>
       <p> <i>Please don't wait weeks or months 
         before doing notifying me of a lost shipment</i>. </p>
       <p> When I receive a PayPal order, 
         the first thing I do is to send an automated confirmation email
 		to the address you specified in the PayPal purchase.
 		This email gives an approximate date 
         you can expect to receive the shipment.
 		If you haven't received the shipment by that date, please
 		<a href="../contact.html">email us</a>, and we'll reship promptly. </p>
 		<p>
 		In some cases, customers have
 		given addresses with both a post office box and a street address.
 		This also creates problems, since the shipment may be directed to
 		either location, or in some cases returned without being delivered.
 		I need your exact mailing address if you want the product delivered
 		in a timely fashion. </p>
 		<p>
 		<I>If you want the product shipped to another location than the address
 		on the PayPal invoice, please email us promptly and let me know
 		where to ship it instead</I>.
 		</p>
       <p> Orders are lost less than one percent 
         of the time. Please understand that I always ship the product promptly 
         and I have no control over losses in the mail. Also, in the current security 
         climate, international shipments will take longer than expected.</p>
       <p> I will always try to get a shipment 
         through, even if it means mailing it twice. </p>
       <p> Q: I didn't receive a confirmation 
         by email of my PayPal order.<br>
         A: I send a confirmation to the email address you used to pay by as soon 
         as I get your PayPal order, so if that isn't your regular email address 
         please check that account. </p>
       <p> Q: Does free shipping cover international orders?<br>
         A: Yes, free shipping covers standard airmail shipping worldwide.</p>
       <p> Q: Does free shipping apply to Australia?<br>
         A: Yes, free shipping covers standard airmail shipping worldwide.</p>
 	  <hr width="25%">
       <p>
 	  	The product can be shipped (as far as I know) to any
 		country in the world.
 		This hasn't stopped people from asking about specific countries:
 	  </p>
       <p> Q: Do you ship to England?<br>
 	    A: Yes, of course.</p>
       <p> Q: Do you ship to Germany?<br>
 	    A: Yes, of course.</p>
       <p>
 	  ... etc., etc., etc.
 	  </p>
 
 	
       <a name="amazon"></a>  
       <h3>Buying the product at Amazon.com</h3>
       <p> Q: I bought a copy through Amazon, 
         can I email you my registration information?<br>
         A: Sorry, unless you purchase the product directly from sacred-texts, 
         I need you to fill out and mail in your registration card. Otherwise I 
         have no way of verifying that you actually bought a copy. Amazon does 
         not send me any customer information.</p>
 
       <p> Q: I lost my registration
 	  card and want to become a registered customer<br>
         A: If you purchased the disk directly from sacred-texts,
 		either using PayPal or mail order, you are already registered.
 		If you purchased the disk from Amazon, and can't find the
 		registration card, you can either send us a photocopy of
 		your Amazon invoice or a photocopy of the <I>back</I>
 		of the jewel case.
 	  </p>
 
       <p> Q: I ordered a copy of the product from Amazon
 	  and got a prior version.<br>
         A: Amazon has a few older copies of the product in their warehouse;
 		also, some websites other than sacred-texts also link to older versions
 		at Amazon because they haven't updated their websites.
 		So there is a small chance that you may
 		get an older version of the product if you order from Amazon.
 		Send in your registration card and I'll send you a free upgrade
 		to the most current version of the product you purchased, if
 		there is a more recent one.
 		For instance, if you purchase a 4.0 version of the CD-ROM from Amazon,
 		just send in your registration card for a copy of the 5.0 version.</p>
 
 
       <a name="mac"></a>  
       <h3>Compatibility</h3>
       <p> Q: Is the product compatible with Macintosh?<br>
         A: Yes, the disk is formatted so it can be read by both PC and Macintosh 
         computers. We have tested it for compatibility with a range of Macintosh 
         computers. The disk does not start automatically on a Mac
 		as on Windows, but normally a folder does open automatically, and you
 		can then double click on the 'index.htm' file to start the
 		disk in your browser.
 	  </p>
 	  <P> Q: Is the product compatible with Windows Vista?<br>
 	   A: Yes, the disk works the same under Vista as Windows XP.
 	   On a stock, clean-installed Vista system the disk will
 	   be loaded into your browser (that is, start) automatically.
 	   There are slightly different procedures for managing autoplay under
 	   Windows Vista than previous versions of Windows, but in general
 	   they are easier to use than before.
 	   Note that Vista may display dialogs warning about 'active content'
 	   when you insert the disk, or use certain features such as the
 	   Tarot card reader.
 	   In this case, you can ignore these warnings.
 	  <P> Q: Is the product compatible with Unix?<br>
 	   A: Customers who use versions of Unix on the PC, such as Linux,
 	   have reported that they were able to
 	   use the disk in the same way as on the Macintosh.
       </P>
 
 	  <a name="downloadcd"></A>
       <h3>Can I just download the contents of the disk?</h3>
       <p> Q: I'm not providing a shipping address, because I want to download the contents of the disk.<br>
 	   A: If you don't supply a complete shipping address, I will simply refund
 	      your money.
 		  The disk is a product which is sent to a postal address.
 		  You can't download it.
 		  Unfortunately, there is a 'feature' in PayPal
 		  which allows you to clear out your shipping address,
 		  even if the seller needs one.
 		  This presents a big difficulty for me.
 		  If I get an order without a shipping address,
 		  I obviously can't fill it.
 		  So I have to attempt to contact the person who sent the order,
 		  which means that I have to spend time chasing down the person
 		  to ask them what their shipping address is.
 		  If I can't obtain a shipping address within about 24 hours
 		  of an order, I generally reverse the charges.
 	  </p>
 	  <p>Q: Why did you refund my money? Just let me download the disk.<br>
 	    It would be unethical for me to accept money for a good or service
 		which I don't provide.
 		Unless I have a shipping address I can't fill your order.
 	  </p>
       <p> Q: Why not just post the disk online so customers can download it?<br>
 	  A: Not everyone is on a high-speed connection
 	     (particularly people in less developed regions), so this
 	     would discriminate against people on dialup.
 		 In addition, putting up a separate area with for-pay content
 		 would be redundant because it would largely duplicate the
 		 existing site. Thirdly, it would also
 		 go against the basic premise of this site,
 		 which is to provide free, anonymous, access to these texts.
 		 I don't want to end up with a two-tier site, one which only
 		 wealthy first-worlders with credit cards can access, and
 		 a 'ghetto' for everyone else.<br><br>
 		 <I>The whole point of the disk is to support equal access to this
 		 content, not lock it up for rich people</I>.

       <h3>Damaged or Lost Disks</h3>
       <p>
 	  Q: The disk arrived in an unreadable state.<br>
 	  A: We warranty that the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM media will

 	  no questions asked, no charge.<BR><BR>
